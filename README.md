## Building Agentic Applications with LangGraph and SingleStore: A Practical Guide!
Agentic applications are the next evolution in AI—systems that not only generate responses but can reason, make decisions, and interact autonomously across tools and data sources. 

In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to build a real-world agentic system using:
- ✅ LangGraph for orchestrating agents
- ✅ SingleStore as the vector database - [Signup to SingleStore](https://bit.ly/Agentic-App) & get free credits
- ✅ OpenAI + Tavily for LLMs and retrieval
- ✅ Python for logic and orchestration

Our final product is a Startup Intelligence Agent—a system that autonomously researches a startup domain, identifies key trends and competitors, generates a pitch, and stores that knowledge for future use.
